# Brave-Rats-Study
 A project to create artificial intelligence as well as human-legible analysis of the game Brave Rats by Seiji Kanai. The ultimate goal is to combine both approaches to enable players to reach as close to the Nash equilibrium as possible, thereby reducing the game entirely to chance.

(The project may be in working order currently as it transitions to a more organized format)
